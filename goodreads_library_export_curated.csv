57249292,Burn: The Misunderstood Science of Metabolism,Herman Pontzer,"Pontzer, Herman",,,,4,4.14,Penguin,Kindle Edition,374,2021,2021,01/11/2024,08/10/2024,non-fiction,non-fiction (#192),read,"This book is about newly emerging insights into human metabolism, and particularly the idea of 'constrained daily energy expenditure'. The take-home message is that the human body has evolved to expend roughly the same number of calories per day pretty much regardless of the level of physical activity (contrary to the old view that more activity resulted in more calories being burned). This has some important implications, for instance, it explains why exercise is ineffective for losing weight (dieting is better as it controls the energy INPUT). It also reframes the situation as one of trade-offs:  if a body has a constant rate of energy expenditure, then introducing more physical activity means it has to expend less energy on other things. For instance, exercise reduces the inflammation response because the body has to divert its energy resources to muscles and other functions, reducing energy spent on unnecessary immune system activity. <br/><br/>Pontzer's writing is engaging and he regales the reader with stories of his time living among the Hadza hunter-gatherer tribe. The book also provides a crash course in evolution, paleoanthropology, diet science, and even dips into climate change at the end. ",,,1,0,,,,,,,

The book gives good background on the justifications for wanting to reach India (i.e. to trade, spread Christianity, and seek out Prester John in Ethiopia), and it was interesting how the various voyages built upon each other, with Portuguese navigators getting further with each one. I found the second half of the book more slow going, with the various escapades of Almeida and Albuquerque, describing battle after battle in too much detail. That said, Crowley does give a good picture of the personalities of the major players at the time. It also would have been good to have more from the perspective of the African, Indian, Arabian, and Indonesian peoples who were forced to suffer the onslaught of Portuguese imperialism.",,,1,0,,,,,,,

The writing had a sort of detached, mythical nature, new chapters would begin without any explanation or context, lots of new characters seemed to be introduced at once, and I didn't understand a number of the references/specific vocabulary used.

The story is about the gradual uncovering of her past trauma (explaining her increasingly debauched behaviour whenever she gets Land Leave) as well as her relationship with the ship's captain Keith as she wins a place on his esoteric self-development 'programme'. Keith is a cult-like figure, obsessed with the Japanese philosophy of wabi sabi, and demands bizarre sacrifices from Ingrid as well as the rest of his staff. <br/><br/>The Odyssey definitely has similarities with the writing of Ottessa Moshfegh (debauchery, dysfunction, a female protagonist with a 'messy' life). The description of life on the ship was also quite Orwellian or Kafkaesque, and I think the book makes a statement about the vapidness and anomie-inducing nature of modern work culture (fitting in nicely with the wabi sabi ideas of ""transience and decay""). <br/><br/>I'm not sure if I understood the ending (or Ingrid's relationship with Keith for that matter), but this isn't the kind of book you read for a typical linear narrative.",,,1,0,,,,,,,

The idea underpinning the book is the ‘Nordic theory of love’. Contrary to misplaced notions that Nordic countries are socialist, this is a philosophy in which individuals are supported by the state so as not to be dependent on it or the other people around them; in other words, these countries bake in liberty from the moment their citizens are born by allowing their parents time off and equipping them with free education and healthcare. <br/><br/>The problem with comparing the USA to anywhere else is that it is an outlier to begin with. So of course the book tends to take the format of “look how bad life is in the USA… but look how much better it is in Scandinavia” (though Partanen does acknowledge that Nordic countries are far from perfect, and that the American outlook can have its advantages). <br/><br/>I was most interested in the section on education, for instance: how Finland reformed its education in the 1970s in anticipation of a knowledge economy; how it takes a supply- rather than demand-side approach to education (it’s a basic human right, not a good driven by demand); and how Finnish teachers are so well respected because of the sheer amount of training they have to undertake (700 hours of classroom practice during a master’s program). There were also interesting references to Beatrice Webb and the role of her idea of a “national minimum of civilised life” in founding Britain’s welfare state. <br/><br/>Altogether though, the book probably should have been cut by at least a third as it’s rather repetitive. There was also too much focus on America – this was necessary due to the comparison, but I felt like I finished the book wanting more insight into Nordic society and culture, not the societal ills of the USA (with which I’m already sadly well-acquainted).

IF you are prepared to wade through the over-written and abstruse writing style. <br/><br/>Some points I took away: photographs are as much an interpretation of the world as paintings are, and exciting photos say something in a new manner; photography is an act of non-intervention - the photographer is a ‘supertourist’ or anthropologist who does not intervene in people’s lives but briefly visits them; how the advent of photography liberated painters from accurately describing reality, allowing them to focus on abstraction; photography is not a form of art all, but a medium through which art can be produced; the historical tendency towards black and white photography is because it was seen as more decorous than colour, or less sentimental and crudely lifelike (Cartier-Bresson renounced colour in his work).

Each section is chronological, containing images from the 1800s through to the early 2000s.<br/><br/>The book definitely improved my knowledge of notable photographers and also gave good insight into their thought processes. There were a few themes that came through for me. One is the idea that good photography involves the ""art of observation"" and ""finding something interesting in an ordinary place"" (Elliott Erwitt). It's about how you frame the world around you in a way that conveys a deeper meaning. Another theme was how gear is only a means to an end - that end being the ability to tell a great story. Also on this theme, the idea that photographers should know their equipment inside out and push it to its limits. <br/><br/>Some stand out bits for me included: Francis Frith and how he sold his grocery business to fund his travels around the world to take photos; how early photographers battled impressively against heavy equipment and the wet collodion process; John Davies' images of post-industrial Britain; Tony Ray-Jones' philosophy of taking photos of events that take longer to read than they do to happen; how Dougie Wallace uses flash to 'provoke' a situation and work with his street subjects rather than melt into the background; and finally Erich Salomon and the lengths he went to to sneak his camera into high society events, concealing his lens in a bowler hat or bagpipes!",,,1,0,,,,,,,

Unfortunately I just found Posh Boys too unfocused and repetitive. <br/><br/>The book is split in two: part one deals with the history of private schools from the medieval period onwards and annoyingly seems to have a particular focus on military figures (Verkaik has written on this topic previously). <br/><br/>Part two takes us into the modern era (up to 2017) but just seems to be an opportunity for the author to have his take on the events and characters of the day.

This is ostensibly a service industry which creates an ‘educational apartheid’, ‘cements elite structures’, and is fundamentally ‘incompatible with the pursuit of a fairer, more cohesive society’. <br/><br/>This is the damning indictment of private schooling by academics David Kynaston and Francis Green. Across 9 chapters, the book examines the potted history of private schools and the enduring inertia of political will to reform them, what their fees actually buy, why parents choose to send their children to them, and detailed options for reform. The authors discuss the effects of extra resources, small class sizes, peer effects, and autonomy on attainment, and often return to the issues of charitable status and proposals to levy VAT (a policy still espoused by the Labour party on the eve of the 2024 general election). <br/><br/>The authors wear their stripes proudly in arguing for the need for reform, and there are some incisive and interesting points made. For instance, it’s often argued that parents should have a right to buy a private education if they so wish – that’s true of certain consumer goods and services, yes, but education is different because it’s ‘formative’ and has huge effects on life chances. There is also criticism of the idea that we can’t abolish private schools because that would leave a gaping hole in the economy – not so, because this assumes a counterfactual in which those parents, students, and teachers all disappear into the ether rather than join – and pay tax through - the state sector. <br/><br/>There is also discussion of how schools choose to justify their charity status through partnerships with state institutions. This is really laughable in many cases, for instance staff serving as governors at state schools, hosting joint debating clubs and drama events, and sharing swimming pools. All they have to do for their tax breaks is to pay lip service to the very idea of ‘public benefit’. <br/><br/>One strength of this book is its detailed proposals for reform. It discusses ideas to reduce both the demand for and supply of private education through contextual admissions policies (a form of positive discrimination), raising fees through taxation, and Open / Fair Access Schemes. Ultimately, though it’s likely that no major reforms will take place – and is it any wonder when one considers that the alumni of the accused extend like tentacles into all the high and influential positions in society? <br/><br/>I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the position of private education in contemporary Britain. The writing quality does vary across the chapters - there's a degree of repetition and over-quoting throughout (and an obsession with em dashes!), but the arguments and evidence are interesting.

A soldier engages in 'directionally motivated reasoning', (aka confirmation bias) according to their biases, prejudices, and identity. In contrast, a scout engages in 'accuracy motivated reasoning' in that they are more concerned with what is really true. Scouts are able to leave their identity at the door while they update their beliefs in the face of new evidence and conduct thought experiments to consider other perspectives (e.g. the double standard test, outsider test, conformity test, selective skeptic test, status quo bias test). <br/><br/>As someone who already thinks of themselves as having a scout mindset, I feel like I didn't learn many things from this book. Since reading about the philosophy of science (e.g. Karl Popper) and working in academia, I have always felt a sense of agnosticism about what is 'true', though I suppose I don't have a track record of engaging in thought experiments to try to 'disprove' my own beliefs, such as they are. Overall, I felt that this book relied a little too much on acecdata and I've have appreciated more discussion of the psychology research literature.",,,1,0,,,,,,,

The empire went from strength to strength, being initially feared by other European powers in the C17, admired as a centre of culture and refinement in the C18, and finally looked down upon by other European colonial powers in the C19 as it declined. Interesting parts included discussions of Janissary units and the Collection, eunuchs, harems, fratricide, rivalries with the Habsburgs and later the Russians, and finally events leading up to WWI. <br/><br/>I learnt a fair bit from this book but generally I don't think it was very well written: too many asides going into too much detail, some amount of repetition, and sometimes little sense of the bigger picture.

Above all, these stories provide insight into the social mores of the time, but also things like the first use of forensic evidence, the societal role of midwives, and church-sanctioned torture. The most prominent theme is that of suicide (or 'felo de se') - the early moderns had different ideas about suicide which carried its own sentence and had very negative social consequences for the remaining family (e.g. profane burial, forfeiture of estate). I knocked my rating down from 5 stars because quite a few of the examples were about suicide, and it'd have been nice to have a bit more variety.

The Sleepwalkers is a big fat history book about the causes of WWI that is extremely well-researched and articulately argued. Apparently there is still debate about Germany's culpability in igniting the conflict (its imperial ambitions, the 'blank cheque' it gave to Austria-Hungary, the 'Fischer thesis' from the 1960s), but Clark argues against this by examining the evidence and framing Germany as but one of a number of imperialistic and paranoid European powers at the time.

This was a difficult read thanks to its heavy themes of bullying, depression, suicide, and nihilism, but these were countered by its brevity and easy-to-read prose. The 14-year-old unnamed narrator is bullied mercilessly for his lazy eye to the extent that he becomes somewhat disassociated from reality (there are some very upsetting scenes). He enters into an off-and-on friendship with fellow bullied classmate Kojima. I find it difficult to articulate, but there is a theme here about meaning. Kojima finds meaning in lots of things, including being bullied, and this view is contrasted with that of Momosa, one of the bulliers, who expresses his nihilistic worldview and utter rejection of any meaning at all. Once the bullying comes to a stop, the narrator gets corrective surgery for his eye and begins to see the world in a new way - perhaps this is a metaphor for the oppressive chokehold suffered by victims of bullying.

This made sense for the first part of the book where Juliet is receiving letters from the various members of the Literary Society, but I expected it to change to prose when she actually travelled to the island. The letter-writing just made it feel 2D to me, and the trailer for the film makes the story feel much more 'alive'.

As a textbook, the writing is dense and hard-going, but there are some interesting insights to be had. The book covers a lot of material, dealing with a patchwork of reports, acts, and circulars, with dedicated sections for each of the four nations in every chapter. But it also discusses some of the underlying themes and motivations, and trends in educational policy. For me, one of the most interesting of these was the enduring legacy of the grammar school - how subsequent structural reforms always harked back to the 'good old days' of grammar schooling experienced by the vast majority of policymakers (despite early acknowledgement that they exacerbate social inequality). Another unavoidable trend is the role of globalisation, neoliberalism, and the knowledge economy on education throughout the decades, with schools moving from a child-centred approach (e.g. Plowden report) to data-, economic-, and market-driven principles (and the negative impact this had on teacher recruitment and retention).

Degrowth is an approach in ecological economics which argues that we need to stop focusing on growth in order to live within planetary boundaries and create a more equal society. <br/><br/>The first part of the book lays out the history of capitalism and sketches out its worldview (enclosure, elite accumulation, artificial scarcity, exchange-value vs use-value - I found this the most interesting part). It also introduces a sort of philosophical schism between animist and dualist beliefs (e.g. Descartes' ideas of man's dominion over nature), and considers whether technology can save us from climate disaster (covering carbon capture, renewables, and the Jevons paradox). <br/><br/>The second part considers the (tenuous) relationship between GDP and human wellbeing (McKeown thesis, Easterlin paradox) and some alternative metrics like the Genuine Progress Indicator. After this comes the suggested pathway to degrowth: ending planned obsolescence, cutting advertising, shifting from ownership to usership, ending food waste, and scaling down industry. This section also deals with proposed solutions to the unemployment this would create, though not convincingly in my opinion. The final chapter was a strange amalgamation of things from previous chapters, spending a bit of time reconsidering animism. <br/><br/>This was an interesting read, though covers a lot of material in a short time, and I wish it had spent longer on concrete solutions than (sometimes repetitive) hand-wringing and vagaries.

Chasing the Devil follows much the same format, this time retracing the steps of Barbara and Graham Greene as they trekked across Sierra Leone and Liberia in the 1930s. This time Tim is accompanied by travelmates David, Johnson, and Mr Omaru, and the book is much more introspective as he recounts his time in Liberia as a newspaper reporter. <br/><br/>Chasing the Devil employs the same mixture of travel writing and history, though the various coups and civil wars are hard to keep up with. Towards the end, the book delves briefly into the Poro secret jungle society and touches on the role of colonialism as a cause of the challenging state of many modern African countries (i.e. because Liberia was set up initially as a free country, yet nevertheless suffers untold problems).

This is exactly what Chevalier does with this story of Griet, a 16-year-old maid working in the Vermeer household in mid-1660s Delft. Griet is headstrong and intelligent, though inexperienced and naive, and finds herself increasingly and dangerously close to the painter as she becomes his assistant.

Frankl retells his experiences of surviving Auschwitz as a way into logotherapy, his life's work and contribution to psychotherapy. The ideas of the book are best summed up with Nietzsche's quote: ""He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how"". Frankl gives examples of how meaning made everyday life in the concentration camp bearable, i.e. curiosity, humour, cultivating one's mind, and clinging to 'shreds of hope'. There are definitely strong crossovers with Stoicism here, as finding meaning in suffering is also a key theme. <br/><br/>Frankl lists three ways to discover the meaning of one's life: (1) by creating a work or doing a deed; (2) by experiencing something or encountering someone; and (3) by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering. I also found the idea of 'tension' interesting, i.e. that there is/should be a continuous mismatch between one's present and future self (things you want to become, things you want to do, etc) as this drives a person to find meaning and do things.

A key theme is the role of economics in the transition to renewable energy and how the 'learning curve' and economies of scale bring down the cost over time to make it gain traction and eventually reach convergence with fossil fuels. The book also uses interesting case studies such as Tesla's effect on the cost of lithium-ion batteries.

The Buried Giant is a story of a couple (Beatrice and Axl) in Anglo-Saxon England on a journey to find their long-lost son.

Beatrice and Axl get roped into a side-quest involving Wistan the Saxon warrior and Sir Gawain the gnarled Arthurian knight. What unfolds is an attempt to kill the she-dragon and thus end the 'mist'.

I think the title ""Everything you need to know..."" is a bit misleading, even though the book does cover a range of topics across its 12 chapters. Phillips is shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, and accordingly most of her examples and anecdotes revolve around issues emanating from this post.

Its key take home message is that meritocracy is a myth, and access to and progress in elite professions is still largely determined by a peron's social background. <br/><br/>People from upper middle class backgrounds are 3.6 times more likely to be in one of the elite professions of law, journalism, medicine, and architecture. They are also likely to earn more than their working class colleagues who attended the same universities and attained first degrees. Most of the book deals with the drivers of social inequality in the workplace, revealed through extensive interviews. Some of the key hidden mechanisms include behavioural codes (having the 'right' accent, dress, and a sense of 'polish'), informal sponsorship, and ‘social closure' or gatekeeping. The key to understanding many of these mechanisms is the concept of ‘homophily', or individuals being tied through cultural affinity (i.e. those more likely to get sponsored/promoted tend to share cultural ties with those already in positions of power). No wonder that people from working class backgrounds often resort to acts of ‘self-elimination', suffering feelings of insecurity and estrangement from their upbringing that result in the avoidance of opportunities to progress. <br/><br/>This was a good read (albeit depressing) and I found it was pitched at the right level. Note that all of the above is nicely illustrated in another report by Sam Friedman in 2021 concerning social inequality in the UK civil service ('Navigating the labyrinth'). <br/>",,,1,0,,,,,,,

Most of the book consists of vignettes of violence and racism perpetrated by the white Afrikaner establishment against the black population of South Africa, but also of violence within this population itself (e.g. between the ANC and UDF; between warring Zulu factions). What made the book particularly interesting was Malan's own dual personality: he has a 'traitor's heart' because he is split between being ""a Just White Man and an Afrikaner with a disease of the soul"". He describes himself as a left-leaning liberal who is vehemently against apartheid, yet is simultaneously subject to an ingrained historical racist ideology he must fight within himself. The book was a good read, though harrowing in many places. I think it would help to have some background knowledge of South African history to appreciate it.<br/><br/>I'm going to note here some of the memorable things I came across in this book:<br/>- The brushing off of disgusting racist acts such as police brutality as ""just another of those South African things""<br/>- Malan's description of fear and ignorance of the black population. Apartheid ideology promulgated the idea of 'separate development' and the idea that blacks and whites are irrevocably different. Malan was therefore scared to ask questions about black culture, for fear of unwittingly 'playing into' this ideology. He contends that mutual fear leads to intractable ethnic violence.<br/>- The story of Simon the Hammerman, a black man so belittled and crushed by white oppression that he took to murdering white families as they slept in their beds. His lawyers' exploration of the idea of 'political forensic psychology' - the idea that perhaps apartheid could be a mitigating factor in Simon's behaviour.<br/>- The Randfontein miners' riots led by Themba Ngwazi.<br/>- The image of a mourning white mother enraged at her son's heart being donated to a black man. The image of an elderly white woman losing her sight, enraged at accidentally waving to black people on the street (the petty nature of racism).<br/>- Malan's hilarious description of the Afrikaans language: 'We're speaking the tongue of my tribe, a guttural bastard Dutch in which the r's roll like thunder and the g's grate like a shovel in cold gravel. It is a brutal language...""<br/>- The story of Neil Alcock, the white farmer who was incensed by the dumping of surplus milk wile black Africans starved. His unjust death at the hands of warring Zulus. This is the final part of the novel and the story caused Malan to question his liberal worldview. ",,,1,0,,,,,,,

I think the book is a product of its time and needs to be interpreted within the context of 1950s/60s second-wave feminism and the post-WWII threat of nuclear war. It's a very messy novel, not only in terms of its structure, but in its content - numerous affairs, a drawn-out mental breakdown, a suicide attempt, a stepmother eloping with her stepson, and the bizarre relationship at the end between Anna and Saul.

Henrich explains: ""when relational bonds are fewer and weaker, individuals need to forge mutually beneficial relationships, often with strangers. To accomplish this, they must distinguish themselves from the crowd by cultivating their own distinct set of attributes, achievements, and dispositions"". As Europens became more individualistic and prosocial towards strangers, they established voluntary organisations, universal laws, the scientific method, etc. Protestantism really catalysed this underlying psychology, which helped to spark literacy and a particular work ethic. <br/><br/>The first part of the book was quite drawn out and full of jargon, but it gets more interesting after that as the reader starts to appreciate how each part of the puzzle fits together.",,,1,0,,,,,,,

Dickens' first 'proper novel' is the story of an orphan boy brought up in a workhouse. Only, it isn't really a story ABOUT Oliver, but rather the tug-of-war between the characters surrounding him. On the one hand, Oliver is exploited by Mr Bumble, Mrs Sowerberry, and Fagin, while on the other hand, he is protected by Mr Brownlow and Mrs Maylie who ultimately see the story through to its happy conclusion. I think nature/nurture is a key theme in this book, which is illustrated through the contrast of Nancy and Rose, both orphans but with very different life experiences. ",,,1,0,,,,,,,

The author takes a long time to make his point, and I thought large parts of the book were unnecessary and didn't seem to relate to the question at hand (it felt like 'look how much I know about the various revolutions Homo Sapiens has been through' rather than being to the point). I bumped it up from 2 to 3 stars after looking at my Kindle highlights though because there were some interesting insights. <br/><br/>It's essentially a economics book trying to trash the 'economic problem' which says that we work because our desires are infinite but our means are limited (no, Suzman argues, there's evidence of humans doing work when it wasn't necessary). I think the book spent too much time on prehistory (and even discusses the second law of thermodynamics). <br/><br/>It's broadly chronological: cooking food gave us free time and represented the start of culture (transforming things). Even hunter-gatherers had free time, and this helped language to develop. Then early climate change created food scarcity, prompting people to start producing (farming) food. This led to surplus, writing, and specialisation of jobs but also bad things like pestilence and overpopulation. With the increasing efficiency of the Industrial Revolution (Taylorism), people felt more detached than ever from their work (Durkheim's 'anomie'). This efficiency also served to reduce working hours, but because of consumerism, people continued to work to afford the things they wanted to purchase. The rise of the third sector and 'bullshit jobs' in recent times shows how we continue to work hard because it gives us a sense of community and belonging. <br/><br/>The latter parts of the book were definitely the most interesting. Of course, a book on a huge topic like 'work' can never be exhaustive, but I'd have liked more content on the psychology of work and deeper probing into the notion that work gives us a sense of belonging and identity.

I read this because it's cited in Gail Nattrass' A Short History of South Africa (2019). It was originally published in 1977 under the same title, so this is a major update. Johnson's major contention is that ""South Africa can either choose to have an ANC government or a modern industrial economy"", but not both. It's essentially a catalogue of fatal errors by the ANC party (corruption, mismanagement, etc) since Mandela up until 2015. It also gives insight into Zuma's presidency, exploring how his Zulu heritage effectively created a system of 'chiefly patronage' rather than a typical Western-style democracy. Of course, since the book's publication Zuma has been ousted (with over 300 deaths in the eventual fallout), running contemporaneously with Covid. No regime change just yet, but I think this will just strengthen Johnson's case that 'things have to go to get worse before they get better'. I haven't lived in SA since 2001 so of course this was going to be challenging, but Johnson makes it even harder with his writing, liberally peppering his dry lists of facts with names and references.

Chapter 7 is where Watson hits her stride, giving examples of semicolon use from different authors. I learnt that, among other things, semicolons can be used to amplify parallel structure ('like a stone skipping across water'), and to signify pauses for reflection or uncertainty. If writers like Irvine Welsh can use semicolons effectively, they can't be *that* pretentious.<br/><br/>Watson also makes the point that grammar rules are just a stick to beat people with; that criticising someone's grammar or punctuation is really an ad hominem attack, detracting attention from substance and argument.

Leo Colston reflects back on a summer spent at his upper class schoolmate's estate half a century earlier in 1900. The book is full of symbolism and is a sort of bildungsroman, dealing social class divisions and Leo's (mis)understanding of adult relationships and intentions. Blinded by his boyhood crush on his friend's older sister Marian and respect/fear for the working class farmer Ted Burgess, Leo is roped into becoming a go-between, carrying messages between the two as they carry out their affair.

A Town Like Alice has the same methodological, plodding storytelling style. It sets out the interesting continent-spanning life of Jean Paget who uses her inheritance to grow a little dustbowl town in the Australian outback. At times, the story was stymied by too much unnecessary detail, and for me, the choice of a floating narrator was awkward - the story in Australia would be in full swing and suddenly the narrator, based in London, would pop up unexpectedly. Published in 1950, the book is also very much a product of its time, reflected in what from a modern day perspective seems like rather cringeworthy language.  ",,,1,,,0,,,,,

On one hand, it's a very engaging synthesis of the cognitive science of learning, in a general sense. Dehaene dispels the myth of tabula rasa by showing that babies come into the world with pre-wired expectations and learning algorithms (and this is why machine learning has a lot to live up to, and there is a lot of comparison with artificial intelligence). A good example of this is Chomsky's idea of the language acquisition device and how infants engage in shared attention. Dehaene also deals with the nurture side of the debate, discussing brain plasticity, sensitive periods, and his neuronal recycling hypothesis in reading development. All fascinating stuff. <br/><br/>On the other hand, I feel that the book's subtitle ('the new science of education') is misleading; much of the work discussed here isn't strictly 'new', and much of it isn't directly relevant to education. For instance, the final section discussing the 'four pillars of learning', much of the work relates to animal studies or infants, with only a few light pepperings of education research. To some extent this reflects the dearth of scientific education research, something Dehaene acknowledges in the conclusion, but I wonder how some teachers would react to his 13 key take away messages such as 'enrich the environment', 'accept and correct mistakes', and 'set clear learning objectives'. Not exactly revolutionary. (I note how this subtitle has been changed from 'why brains learn better than any machine, for now' in the hardback edition - much more appropriate). <br/><br/>In conclusion, I think this book is best enjoyed with its original subtitle. Don't expect in-depth application of cognitive science to education, and just enjoy the neuroscience!",,,1,,,0,,,,,

Nora Acton, the stunning young debutante is seemingly traumatised by a disturbing attack on the eve of Freud's arrival in Manhattan. Dr Younger, an avid follower of the psychoanalytic method, carries out treatment under Freud's paternal guidance. <br/>The story is long and convoluted and seems to be sewn together rather hastily at the climax of the novel. <br/>The false pretense of Nora's trauma and symptomology serves to underline the absurdity and fallibility of Freud's school of thought. Dr Younger makes, what he thinks, are insightful and explanatory remarks throughout the investigation, only to figure out that her behaviour was a farce - an elaborate ploy to frame someone for murder.<br/>The novel explores the fractious and strained relationship between Freud and his beleaguered disciple, Carl Jung.
